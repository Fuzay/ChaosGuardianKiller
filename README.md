# ChaosGuardianKiller

Little Project to automate Draconic Evolution Guardian fight. This project has been started for my Youtube series "Minecraft Modd√©".

## TODO

* Make the robot travel from anywhere to the dragon (multiples of 10 000) **done (you need to set the distance between two dragon)**
* Make the robot charge itself when it needs it **done (need to give him charger solar and redstone block in this order)**
* Check wether or not the dragon is alive when it arrives to the island **done**
* Break the dragon's shields **done (the dragon kill the robot if the dragon is loaded and the shiel is not killed after one attack)**
* Attack the dragon itself
* Going to the core of the island to break the chaos shard **done (need a pickaxe)**

Currently the main challenge is to find a way for the robot to kill the dragon.
Feel free to try it out yourself (maybe in a separated branch).
